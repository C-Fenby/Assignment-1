        <br>
        <p>My idea is for a mobile phone application that is readily available for free download to make life slightly easier. This application will scan and reads the cooking instructions on your store bought products to display them in an easy to read way, with preset timer accounting for flipping and rotating instructions. Its design will be simple and easy to use with minimal interface to keep it simple and user friendly. Furthermore, I feel it best to be used as a free application in hope to reach as many people as possible, to be able to make life just a little bit easier for everyone.</p>
        <p>The motivation behind this product came about one night when a friend burnt an oven bake pizza. The friend who became distracted had forgotten to set a timer to remind us of when the pizza would be ready to be taken out of the oven. By the time we had realized, it was too late and the smell of burnt dough filled our noses, thus sparking the idea for an application to remedy the situation. The simplicity of the idea and niche market is appealing to me as it will allow room to develop and grow my skills.</p>
        <p>The application will be a simple design, with basic functionality to keep it easy to use but with room to grow with future updates if desired. The main functionality of the application will be to display the relevant information for cooking instructions back to the user and have a preset timer. Firstly, the user will input the cooking method they choose to use from one of the following three conventional oven, fan forced oven and air fryer. They will then be prompted to use their devices camera to capture the area of the packaging that displays the information. With the use of optical recognition technology, it will read the information on packaging to gather the relevant information needed. It will search for the temperature, cooking time and instruction for rotating of flipping required. Once successfully translated into the device a screen will display showing the temperature required for cooking, the time for cooking, any instruction for rotating or flipping the product and a reminder to preheat the appliance used for cooking. A large button labeled “Ready” will appear alongside this information linked to a timer that will start once activated. After the user has placed the product in the appliance, they can then click the “Ready” button. Once the timer has sounded you will either be prompted to flip or rotate the product and restart it again or informed that your food is now ready to be served depending on the products cooking instructions. The aim is to release it as a free application as to get the most user feedback as possible, and leaving room for future updates of additional functionality such as, dietary calculator, favorite food, multiple cooking timers/interfaces and average meal cost per week. </p>
        <p>The tools and technologies required to complete this application could be easily mad using an app development company (Neha Baluni, n.d.). However, for the purpose intended of displaying a skill and knowledge to a possible future employer, it will be created using customed designed coding and visual design developed personally. The intended use for the application is for a smart phone or similar device and will use some of the standard hardware and features on the device such as clock, camera, touch screen and speakers to allow the application to function as intended. </p>
        <p>The skills required and hardware for building this application will be readily available and easy to obtain. The knowledge of coding and design will be learned thought a Bachelor of information and Technology that I intend to undertake at RMIT online university. As knowledge of programing knowledge is a must in building the application, these include JavaScript, Kotlin and C++ to name a few (Spinx crafting digital, 2021). The hardware required will be supplied by user when they install the application onto their smart phone or relevant device, allowing access to the camera and speakers previously mentioned. </p>
        <p>Once all the parts of the project have been combined the outcome will be a functional application easily installed onto a smart phone or similar device. Resulting in a user friendly, easy to access cooking aid to help prevent the waste of precious food and money. Never again shall the smell of burnt pizza dough fill the room and the feel of dread hit your heart as you left running to the oven to attempt to save what is left the now ash remains of a delicious snack. Nor shall the tase of charcoal fill your mouth as you try to eat around its dry and burnt remains.</p>
