        <p>The results of the online tests taken did not come as a great deal of a shock to me. When taking the Myers-Briggs test I read a statement saying, “scarily accurate.” after completing the test I did get the feeling of “scarily accurate.” apart from a few pieces of information in the later deep dive into the personality type. The following tests, learning style and big five personality built upon the Myers-Briggs test. All of which had the same outcome of me being an outside the box thinker and not really relying on other people for much and being a hands on learner. This did not come to a shock to me as over the last few years I recognized this learning my trade. </p>
        <p>From the information I have been given and reflected on have opened my eyes to how I function in a team based environment. It has been hard for me to work in groups in the past for varying reasons, as stated in the test results I tend to come across as arrogant and dismissive of other people and tend to take on more then I should. That leads to hindering the effectiveness of the group as a hole.</p>
        <p>When forming a team, I should look for likeminded individuals with similar values as myself. A group with a good team leader to help delegate roles and keep me on track. Alternately a group that may require some outside the box thinking and new ideas. Personally, I feel that no matter the group I am in I will come across struggling situations but that is the only way to grow as a person and become a better version of yourself that may a few years from now fit into a completely different category of personality type.</p>
