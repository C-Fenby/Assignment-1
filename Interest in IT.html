        <p>My interest in IT is not quite realized yet as my interest in the subject has recently been restored. Since a young age technology has always fascinated me, I found myself asking how and why it works the way it does. Although money, location and family with outdated views on technology held me back from pursuing the passion. When I was young, I would find myself pulling apart old televisions and VCRs trying to find out how they worked. Later I would find myself almost irreversibly altering the settings on things as I found my way deeper down the rabbit hole. But living in a rural area with limited access to the information and family members reluctant to adopt technology hindered my development. After finishing school, I became a Plumber Gasfitter/Appliance technician, as most of this job was pulling apart and delving into these settings to rectify an issue with the appliance, and ultimately reigniting the spark for technology. I then built my 1st computer in 2017 and finally being able to connect to the internet I was off.</p>
        <p>After the birth of my son and working in the same field for 9years I found myself with a thirst for knowledge. I started going to PAX Australia and rubbed shoulders with developers and course providers, with caused me to investigate possibly doing further education on the subject. Although being I only finished year 11 VCAL and did not perform verry well in a school setting I was turned off the as most courses required a level of intelligence, I felt I did not possess. Then one day in a passing comment about the subject to an old friend from school, he revealed his interest in IT as well and pointed me to a Diploma of Information technology that would teach me everything I needed, and all I had to do is pass the Introduction courses.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m hoping my studies can give me an overview and an in-depth look into a wide range of subject matter, yet also allow me to sink my teeth into a subject that really resonates with me. I have the personality that allows me to even though I am not interested in a subject matter, still have the desire to understand it on a fundamental level. I expect to learn what fields of IT I am most passionate about and how I can further my skill, knowledge and ultimately be able to start a career in that desired field.</p>
