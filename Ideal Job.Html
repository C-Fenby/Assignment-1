        <p style="text-align: center;">Back End Developer (indeed, 04/06/2021)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This position has a vast range of duties that it requires from you, mainly on the backend side of the companies applications. Writing lines of code, building features for existing apps, QA testing and building up a web or mobile application spark my interest the most. Working remotely from home is a must as I do not want to uproot my family and move into the city or suburbs of a state capital, giving the freedom to care and be present for my son as much as possible.</p>
        <p>An extensive knowledge and skill level is a must for this position as its duties are so vast, a brief overview of some is as follows. Skills in developing applications both front and backend, QA testing building features and applications as well as the following.</p>
        <p><b>Languages known</b>
            <ul>

        <p>The Skills relevant skills that I currently possess can be counted on one hand by a 3year old. They include a basic knowledge of HTML and Github. My experience in the IT industry is non-existent as I am yet to have any tangible skills to be hired for a role.</p>
        <p>My journey to one day be qualified for a role like this is a long difficult one. Firstly, I will be required to pass, RMI-CPT110 “Introduction to Information Technology” and RMI-CPT120 “Introduction to programming” before I am eligible for RMI-CPT-DEG “Bachelor of Information Technology”. While I am studding the bachelor, I will attempt to find an entry level job in the IT field to be able to gain experience and exposure and real-world use for the skills and knowledge I am acquiring. Once I have completed the bachelor, I will then pursue another course to further my knowledge in areas I feel lacking or more passionate about. </p>
